-	Chain Reaction of some sort. When you box an area, the walls go
	in all four directions until they hit the edge or encounter another
	box situation.

-	Box a bigger area than just 1 x 1.

X	Caveman throws a runaway wheel that destroys all in its path until
	it reaches the edge of the playfield or gets BOXED!

-	Bonus wave type, Jewels or Prizes appear in the center of each
	square. The only way to get a jewel is to box in(capture) that
	area.

-	Switch modes during gameplay, just like pinball. For instance
	Have a mode where all scores are double. Or a mode where the
	Cavemen are on the run. The reason I thought of this is because
	I was listening to TAXI music and heard the mball tune. I love
	changes in flow. It makes things much more exciting. So let's
	do something of that sort and with music as cool as TAXI.

-	Two types of Buy-in:
		1)	Straight foward any player can buy-in as long
			as the game is game is in play. Also, one player
			games will be allowed to continue from where they
			left off.

		2)	Other players can buy-in while game is in play.	
			No continuation time is offered at the end of
			the game. It's over.

X	When you've maxed out your bars, the eldest should flash.

-	Plant prizes:
		Brain Food
		Speed
		Bad Shroom (slow motion dude)

X	Add adjustment that disallows high score to date entry.

-	Bonus Wave, the footrace. Let the players bang on their fire
	buttons to make the dino move faster. First one to the finish
	wins.

-	Something that lays down invincible bones.

-	Bonus Wave, Hidden prizes. Have TROG run out and bury a bunch of
	stuff while the players are watching.  Then, let the dinosaurs out
	and try to find all of the buried treasure. Could do a Rally X thing.
	If you pick up the right one first then your scores are two X.

-	Upper wave, all eggs appear then disappear, you have to find
	them in order to get home.

-	Bonus Wave, give 30 seconds too collect all of the presents you
	can, no enemies, just obstacles.

-	Stringer, when there is a position delta, reflect that change
	in the thing that stores the last line position for carriage return.

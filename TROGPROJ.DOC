				  The Concept
				  -----------

	     TROG is designed as a four player dedicated, two player

	kit game.  As the player, you have the power to draw walls between

	posts arranged in an (m x n) grid with possible holes.  With your

	wall drawing power you must concentrate on keeping your character

	from walking out of the grid.  There will be four different

	characters to choose from:

	      Player 1)	REX the Red tyrannosaurus rex.
	      Player 2)	ELVIS the Yellow stegosaurus.
	      Player 3)	BLOOP the Blue brontosaurus.
	      Player 4)	SPIKE the Purple triceratops.

	     The object of each grid is to lead your dinosaur to all of 

	his/her eggs.  Upon completion of this task, an exit for your

	dinosaur will materialize.  This is the only safe way to exit the

	grid.  As soon as the first dinosaur exits, the grid is complete.


	     Between each grid bonuses will be awarded.  The first player

	to complete the task will recieve a bonus plus something for each

	egg collected.  The third grid and every fourth grid after will

	be a bonus grid. This will offer the players a risk free challenge

	for points.


	     All sounds simple, however there exists an interesting "man"

	named TROG.  His only ambition in life is to capture the dinosaurs.

	At the outset of the game, TROG is equipped with only his bare hands

	as tools.  Have no fear for TROG is somewhat of a human. He has the

	ability to learn and adapt to his situation.  As the game progresses

	TROG will invent more tools, and occasionally discover something

	useful.  After every bonus grid, there will be an intermission that

	depicts TROG as he invents or discovers.


	     Our plan is to complete TROG for ACME 1990.  Below is the 

	schedule that will make this a reality.
